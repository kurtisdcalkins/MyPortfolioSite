Future plans:
1. Add more projects to showcase, as I continue to learn and develop my coding skills. 
2. Include a page which displays my resume with downloadable/printable version.
3. Create pages for specific programs/applications that I make to give more detail on how they work and how I made them.
4. Continue to refine the overall appearance and style of the site.
