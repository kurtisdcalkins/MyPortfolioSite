                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hello! I am Kurtis and I am from Colorado (North-Metro Denver). I have a BS in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Colorado at Denver. I have worked as a manufacturing engineer, primarilty in the medical device industry, since 2015. </p>
                <p>I am looking to switch careers into software development. Programming has intrigued me for years, and with a few of the software projects I've been able to work on throughout my career piqueing my interest and excitement, I have decided to persue software development.</p>
                <p>The goals of this website are to display my work and demonstrate some of the skills I have learned.</p>
